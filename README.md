# ancient-greek-modern-accents

Many native Modern Greek speakers will read and pronounce Ancient Greek (whether in their head or aloud) using modern pronunciation of the words. 

This script takes a text in polytonic Greek and outputs (something close to) the representation of how the words would be pronounced in modern monotonic orthography. It could be used to either simplify a text for one's own reading, or to take an Ancient Greek text and turn it into a format that a text-to-speech software could read aloud according to Modern Greek pronunciation.
